I chose to use .NET Core MVC since that is what I usually work with.
I chose Yahoo and Bing as the two search engines which I would be getting the results from.
I created a simple two page application, the first page was a simple search bar, replicating that of the major search engines.
The second page was a list results page which diplayed the results of the search in a card like format.

I used a WebClient to go and fetch the data and then HtmlAgilityPack to manipulate and access the HTML contents.

The application can be run by downloading the project and running it directly from VisualStudio.
